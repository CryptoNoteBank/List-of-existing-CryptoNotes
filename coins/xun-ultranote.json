        "reason": "The Ultranote cryptocurrency is based on Cryptonight and is presented as a fork of DigitalNote (XDN). The use of a highly renowned technology hides a massive infinite coin emission. The first block gave 18 bln coins to devs. Each locked coin can give up to 3% yield through yearly interests. While these 18 bln coins provide huge interests to devs, enthousiasts are asked to mine the coin for 150 XUN block reward per 2 minutes at their power and hardware expenses... When 18 bln premined coins give 540 million XUN a year, mining only gives 39 millions coins a year (365 days x 24 hours x 30 blocks per hour). The devs will always own more than 90-95% of the emitted coins. They also deny any discussion and rejects the 39 millions vs 540 millions fact. Because of this, this coin can not be seen as a fair and legitimate POW. The coin is not totally dead but its value may tend to 0 satoshi as long as the devs get interests and some retard people realize...",
